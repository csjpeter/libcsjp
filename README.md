# libcsjp
This is a small merely experimental, in-progress hobby library for c++.
Provides the basics like excpetion, string, containers, logging, etc.
I heavily rely on exceptions with RAII technique and ownership based resource management while avoiding STL as much as I can.

## compilation

The scripts ubuntu.sh, mxe.sh, android.sh can be used.

If you are using ubuntu or debian, you might need to install the following packages:

 - git g++ apt-file libicu-dev graphviz doxygen devscripts filepp pkg-config build-essential:native
